Hosted on AWS EC2 | Resembles a Blogging Platform in Functionality

Developed and deployed a Django web application simulating a multi-vendor student management system, where each “vendor” represents a distinct educational institute managing its students and courses. It features a blog-like function that allows vendors to publish course names.

Key Features:
- User authentication and role-based access (e.g., admin, vendor)
- Hosted on AWS EC2 with static/media file handling via Nginx and Gunicorn
- PostgreSQL backend and secure deployment practices (SSL, environment variables, etc.)
- Integrates OpenID Connect, Docker, Kubernetes deployment and Sonarqube
